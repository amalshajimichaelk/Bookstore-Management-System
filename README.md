<h1>Book Store Management System</h1>


This project is a desktop application for managing a book stall or small bookstore. It allows the owner or staff to log in securely, manage their complete book inventory (add, update, delete, and load books), and process customer sales through a checkout system.

It's designed for bookstall managers/staff who need a simple tool to track inventory and sales, and also serves as a comprehensive project for Java students learning to connect a database to a Swing UI using the MVC architecture.
